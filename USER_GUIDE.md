# EpiStratify SNT Toolkit - User Guide

## What is this app?

EpiStratify is a planning tool for malaria control programs. It follows the WHO's 10-step Subnational Tailoring (SNT) process to help countries decide which interventions to use in different areas based on local malaria data.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create an Account
- Go to https://epi-stratify.vercel.app
- Click **"Create an account"**
- Fill in your name, email, and a password (min 8 characters)
- Click **Register**

### 2. Log In
- Enter your email and password
- Click **Sign In**

### 3. Create a Project
- From the Dashboard, click **"New Project"**
- Give your project a name (e.g., "Zambia SNT 2025")
- Optionally add a description and country

## The 10-Step Workflow

Once you create a project, you'll see the SNT workflow with 10 steps. Work through them in order:

| Step | What to do |
|------|-----------|
| 1. Planning | Set scope, objectives, and timeline |
| 2. Data Assembly | Gather health facility and survey data |
| 3. Data Quality | Upload data files and run quality checks |
| 4. Epidemiological Stratification | Set risk thresholds and classify areas |
| 5. Intervention Assessment | Review current interventions by area |
| 6. Intervention Selection | Choose interventions per risk level |
| 7. Micro-planning | Plan implementation details |
| 8. Costing | Build budget scenarios |
| 9. Implementation | Track rollout progress |
| 10. M&E | Monitor and evaluate outcomes |

### How steps work:
- Steps unlock as you complete prerequisites
- Click a step to open it and fill in the details
- Mark a step as complete when you're done
- You can go back and edit completed steps

## Key Features

### Data Quality Checks
- Upload CSV or Excel files with health data
- The system automatically checks for:
  - Missing values (completeness)
  - Outliers (unusual numbers)
  - Consistency between related fields
  - Timeliness of reporting

### Stratification
- Set thresholds for malaria risk levels (e.g., Low < 5, Medium 5-50, High > 50)
- The system classifies each area into risk levels
- View results on a color-coded map

### Intervention Tailoring
- Based on WHO guidelines, the system recommends interventions for each risk level
- Interventions include: ITNs, IRS, SMC, IPTp, Vaccines, Case Management, and more
- Answer tailoring questions to customize recommendations

### Budget Scenarios
- Create different budget scenarios
- Add cost items for each intervention
- Compare scenarios side by side
- Optimize spending under budget constraints

### Impact Forecasting
- Estimate the impact of your chosen interventions
- See projected cases averted, deaths averted, and DALYs saved
- Compare forecasts across different scenarios

### Reports
- Generate summary reports of your analysis
- Download as CSV for further analysis

## Tips for Testing

- Try creating a project and walking through each workflow step
- Upload a sample CSV file to test data quality checks
- Try different stratification thresholds and see how risk levels change
- Create multiple budget scenarios and compare them
- Report any bugs or confusing parts to the developer
