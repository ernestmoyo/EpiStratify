# EpiStratify 🌍📊

**An open-source digital platform for evidence-based subnational stratification and tailoring of malaria interventions**

Implements the WHO Subnational Tailoring (SNT) framework with epidemiological stratification, geospatial analysis, intervention optimization, and scenario-based impact assessment for National Malaria Programs.

## Why Subnational Tailoring (SNT)?

Malaria transmission and intervention effectiveness vary substantially across space due to differences in epidemiology, vector ecology, intervention coverage, and health system capacity. National-level planning alone often fails to capture this heterogeneity.

The WHO Subnational Tailoring (SNT) framework enables countries to:
- Analyze local epidemiological and operational data
- Stratify malaria risk at appropriate subnational levels
- Tailor intervention packages to local contexts
- Optimize allocation of limited resources
- Compare strategic scenarios and expected impact
- Promote equity by prioritizing high-burden and underserved populations

EpiStratify operationalizes these principles in a transparent digital workflow.
